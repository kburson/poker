# Welcome!

Thank you for interviewing at iTrellis! We hope you find this process
to be fair, transparent, and understandable. Our goal with this
process is to evaluate your skillset, with no "surprises" or "trick
questions" designed to snare the unwary. If you have any questions
about this project or its purpose in the process, please feel free
to email us.

Our goal is not to extract free work out of you with this project;
please spend no more than 10 hours on this project. We believe that
any developer claiming to be a "journeyman" developer can complete
this in that time, but we also understand that certain developers
do some things faster than others.

If you are not familiar with Mercurial (hg), the source control
system used for this project, it is a distributed version control
system (DVCS) similar in concept to git. Numerous tutorials on
Mercurial are available on the Web, but the key commands that you
will need are:

  * "hg clone": To create a clone of the repository.
  * "hg branch": To create a branch for your changes
  * "hg add": To add files to the local working repo
  * "hg commit": To commit local working changes

BitBucket also has a [BitBucket101](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Bitbucket+101) for
those who want to have a look.

**Please fork a copy of our project and create your changes as a
pull request.**

You are also welcome to take a copy of the repo (see the download
link in the BitBucket menu to the right) and host it in your own
source-control system (a la Github), so long as we can get access
to it and view the repository history.

Part of our goal with this process is to be transparent. We believe
that we can always improve, and this process is no exception. We would
love to hear your thoughts about the process (whether we hire you or
not!), and invite you to email us at hr@itrellis.com to give us your
thoughts.

We look forward to seeing your work, and talking with you about
this codebase, our combined future, and working together!
